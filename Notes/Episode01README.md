# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser, enabling its use on servers, desktops, and embedded systems. This is why Node.js is often described with the phrase **"Run JavaScript Everywhere."**

- Maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**.
- Features an **event-driven architecture**.
- Supports **asynchronous I/O** (non-blocking I/O).

## History of Node.js
### Creation and Early Development
- **2009:** Node.js was created by **Ryan Dahl**.
- Initially, he used the **SpiderMonkey JS Engine** (used in Firefox) but switched to **V8 JS Engine** after two days.

### Corporate Backing
- Dahl was initially working independently but was later hired by **Joyent**, a company working on similar technologies.

### Naming and Design Philosophy
- Originally called **Web.js**, later renamed **Node.js**.
- Inspired by **Apache HTTP Server**, which was blocking, Dahl aimed to create a **non-blocking** server that could handle multiple requests efficiently.

## The Role of NPM
- **2010:** The introduction of **NPM (Node Package Manager)** played a crucial role in Node.js' success.
- Without NPM, Node.js might not have grown as it did.

## Platform Expansion
- Initially built for **macOS and Linux**.
- **2011:** Gained support for **Microsoft Windows**.

## Key Events in Node.js Evolution
- **2012:** **Isaac Z. Schlueter** took over maintenance of Node.js and also created **NPM**.
- **2014:** A developer named **Fedor** created a fork called **io.js**, leading to internal controversy.
- **2015:** **Node.js and io.js merged**, forming the **Node.js Foundation**.
- **2019:** **JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged**, creating the **OpenJS Foundation**.

## Summary
Node.js has evolved significantly since its inception. From a simple idea to a widely adopted technology, it has been influenced by numerous contributors and corporations. Its non-blocking I/O model, support for multiple platforms, and the introduction of NPM have made it a dominant force in server-side JavaScript development.

# Episode 02: JavaScript on Server

## Overview
This episode covers the fundamental concepts of running JavaScript on a server. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to client-side execution within web browsers. However, with the introduction of **Node.js**, JavaScript can now be executed on servers, enabling full-stack development with a single language.

## Key Topics Covered
- **What is a Server?**
  - A server is essentially a remote computer that provides data, services, or resources to clients over a network.
  - Communication with a server happens via requests sent using an **IP address**.

- **Understanding IP Address**
  - An IP address (Internet Protocol address) uniquely identifies each device connected to the internet.

- **What is the V8 JavaScript Engine?**
  - The **V8 engine** is a JavaScript engine written in **C++**.
  - It can be embedded into any C++ program and compiles JavaScript into machine code for execution.

- **Node.js and ECMAScript Standards**
  - **Node.js** is a C++ application that embeds the V8 engine.
  - **ECMAScript** is the standardized specification for scripting languages like JavaScript.
  - JavaScript engines (V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra) follow ECMAScript to maintain consistency across different environments.

- **JavaScript Runtime & Node.js Superpowers**
  - Unlike V8 alone, **Node.js extends JavaScript’s capabilities** by allowing API calls, database connections, and server-side operations.

- **How JavaScript Code is Executed**
  - JavaScript is written at a high level and compiled by the V8 engine into **machine code**.
  - This transformation allows computers to process JavaScript efficiently.

- **Low-Level Code Concepts**
  - **Machine Language:** The most basic form of code, consisting of binary (0s and 1s) instructions executed by the CPU.
  - **Assembly Language:** A step above machine language, using symbolic representations for operations and memory addresses.

## Features & Highlights
✔ **Full-Stack JavaScript:** Use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.
✔ **V8 Engine Efficiency:** Fast and optimized JavaScript execution.
✔ **Node.js Capabilities:** API calls, file system access, and database interactions.
✔ **ECMAScript Compliance:** Ensures consistent JavaScript behavior across environments.
✔ **Low-Level Code Insights:** Understanding how JavaScript is processed at a deeper level.

## Conclusion
This episode provides a solid foundation for understanding how JavaScript runs on a server, powered by **Node.js and the V8 engine**. These concepts are crucial for full-stack developers looking to leverage JavaScript beyond the browser.
